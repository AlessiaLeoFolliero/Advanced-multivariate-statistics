# Advanced Multivariate Statistics ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹  

This repository contains an **RMarkdown file** showcasing a detailed statistical analysis of Italian regions. The project explores multivariate statistical techniques applied to a dataset created specifically for this analysis.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview  
The analysis addresses various research questions and includes the following steps:  
1. **Research Questions**: Defining the scope and objectives of the study.  
2. **Dataset Creation and Variables Explanation**: Merging and preprocessing the dataset to suit the analysis needs.  
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Conducting initial exploration and validation of the data.  
4. **Correlation Plot**: Visualizing relationships between variables.  
5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Using Bartlettâ€™s test for dimensionality reduction.  
6. **Multidimensional Scaling**: Reducing dimensions while preserving distances.  
7. **Clustering Methods**:  
   - **Hierarchical Clustering**  
   - **K-Means Clustering**  
   - **PAM Clustering**  
   - **Model-Based Clustering**  
8. **MANOVA**: Performing a multivariate analysis of variance using the clustering results.  
9. **Conclusions and Further Improvements**: Summarizing findings and discussing potential enhancements.  

## ðŸ“Š Additional Content  
The repository also includes a **presentation** featuring:  
- Key plots and visuals.  
- Main conclusions drawn from the analysis.  
- Suggestions for further improvements.  

## ðŸ”— Data Source  
The dataset was sourced from **[DatiOpen](http://www.datiopen.it/)**. Note that the original data was not on the same scale, presenting an additional challenge during preprocessing. The dataset was merged and adjusted to meet the needs of the analysis.  

## ðŸ’¡ Personal Note  
Working with data from my own country has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Exploring these techniques while delving into regional data provided valuable insights and a deeper connection to the project.
